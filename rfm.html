								<h2><a href="#">RFM Analysis</a></h2>
								<p>Applied RFM Analysis using SQL and Power BI for Customer Segmentation</p>
							</header>

								<p><b>Business Problem</b></p>
								<p>The business problem addressed in this RFM analysis project is to understand and segment the customers of a retail company based on their purchasing behavior. By conducting RFM analysis, the company aims to gain insights into customer segments, identify high-value customers, and tailor marketing strategies to enhance customer retention and profitability.</p>
								<p><b>Objective</b> </p>
								<p>The main objective of this RFM analysis project is to segment the retail company's customer base into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior: </p>
								<p><i>Recency (R):</i> How recently a customer made a purchase.</p>
								<p><i>Frequency (F)</i> How frequently a customer makes purchases.</p>
								<p><i>Monetary Value (M):</i>> The monetary value of a customer's purchases.</p>
								<p>The analysis is intended to help the retail company better understand its customer segments and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing efforts, customer engagement, and overall business performance.</p>
								<p><b>Implement</b></p>

								<p><b>Findings</b></p>
								<p><i>Customer Segments and Revenue Distribution:</i> The "Potential Loyalist" segment, with the largest customer base, offers promising potential for long-term loyalty and repeat business. Meanwhile, the "Cannot Lose Them" segment, though smaller in size, is the most valuable, contributing 54% of the company's total revenue. Additionally, the "At Risk" segment, consisting of customers showing signs of disengagement, accounted for a significant 24.46% of the revenue.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/finding_1.png" /></a>
								<p><i>Importance of Customer Retention:</i>The "Cannot Lose Them" and "At Risk" segments together represent 78.46% of the company's total revenue. This highlights the critical importance of customer retention strategies, both for maintaining high-value customers and re-engaging those at risk of churn. Investing in personalized retention efforts can lead to substantial revenue preservation and growth opportunities.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/finding_2.png" /></a>
								<p><i>Opportunity for Growth:</i> The "At Risk" segment presents an opportunity for revenue recovery. Implementing targeted re-engagement and customer retention strategies can potentially prevent these customers from transitioning into the "Lost Customer" category and unlock additional revenue potential.								</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/finding_3.png" /></a>
							  <p><i>Cost-Effectiveness of Customer Retention: </i> Retaining existing customers, particularly those in the "At Risk" segment, can be more cost-effective than acquiring entirely new customers. By prioritizing customer retention, the company can maximize the lifetime value of existing customers and improve overall profitability.</p>
								<p><i>Long-Term Customer Value:</i> The analysis underscores the significance of customer lifetime value. The "Potential Loyalist" segment represents an opportunity for ongoing revenue generation, while re-engaging and nurturing the "At Risk" segment can potentially transform them into loyal and high-value customers.</p>
								<p><b>Recommendations</b></p>
								<p><i>Segment-Specific Strategies:</i> Tailor marketing and retention strategies for each customer segment, with a particular focus on the "Cannot Lose Them" and "At Risk" segments, to maximize revenue from these valuable groups.
								</p>
								<p><i>Customer Retention Initiatives: </i> Implement targeted and personalized retention campaigns for the "At Risk" segment to re-engage customers and prevent churn.
								</p>
								<p><i>Loyalty Programs:</i> Establish loyalty programs to incentivize and reward repeat purchases, especially for customers in the "Potential Loyalist" segment.
